# Simon Says Game

Welcome to the Simon Says game! This project is a web-based implementation of the classic electronic memory game, Simon. The game challenges players to repeat increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds.

# Game Overview

Simon Says is a memory game where players must replicate a sequence of tones and lights. Each round, the game adds one more step to the sequence, and the player must remember and reproduce the sequence correctly. The game ends when the player makes a mistake.
